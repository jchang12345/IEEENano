# IEEENano Project 4 Speed

This project focused on using the arduino nano v3.0, a micro controller, some LEDS, push buttons, and a RGB LED with diodes. I also soldered the
finished product after breadboarding, and uploaded this code in order to make a small interactive game, which was part of the IEEE OPS
program I was involved in. Feel free to examine the code used, and reference the comments/notes on how to reduce errors.
